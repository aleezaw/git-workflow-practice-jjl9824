[Did ChatGPT Write This Article?](https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/did-chatgpt-write-article)

## TheArkonon:
This article is interesting because it delves into the possiblity of what AI can accomplish, especially with the introduction of ChatGPT. Although it isn't perfect, ChatGPT is a huge leap forward on what AI can do. Both students and teachers can use this technology to create a better learning environment for each other. The drawbacks, however, are still present in this technology. It is biased based on its human operater, and will not be 100% accurate, especially if not given enough context on the task its given. Despite that, it is clear that the evolution of this technology will have an impact on our future.

## dolf321(Rami Richani):
Chat-GPT is a tool that is in the eye of the beholder, and without proper usage it can be rendered useless. However, its usefulness is undeniable, as even academics cited in this article state. I don't think that using Chat-GPT with your own words is considered plagiarism, as long as it expresses your ideas and thoughts in a format that is more legible for others. Using the algorithm to organize and structure your thoughts does not make it any less your own.

## Aleeza Wolff:

I was suprised to read this article and hear individuals from the academic community discuss mostly positive aspects of ChatGPT. I do agree that there could be benefits to software which helps professors write exam questions or can be used to outline a presentation; However, I am skeptical of such software available for students to be used for cheating or cutting corners. Having software which could be used to write a paper could be dangerous for academic integrity and probably should not be as available as it is for students to use. I do agree that there is so much AI can accomplish and that this is a step in the right direction, as mentioned above, but I do think there are many downsides to such technology and it must be further monitored until a proper balance is created.
